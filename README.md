# astronet-experiments
Experiments performed during the master thesis "Effects of Altering Input on a Convolutional Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection". All experiments are based on [Astronet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/astronet), and the accompanying [paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta) by Chris Shallue and Andrew Vanderburg (2018). Users are able to replicate these experiments by following the original Astronet [tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/astronet/astronet/README.md).
